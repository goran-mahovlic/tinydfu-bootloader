# TinyDFU Bootloader

## Origins

Luke Valenti's USB module, as adapted by Lawrie Griffiths and others.  Luke's code was created with the purpose of providing a "bit banged" USB port to SPI bridge for his (awesome) TinyFPGA boards.

The original is here - https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-Bootloader

Lawrie Griffiths and David Williams improved on this USB module to dramatically improve its timing performance, and to convert it into a
generic USB - SERIAL bridge. Their work is here - https://github.com/davidthings/tinyfpga_bx_usbserial

## This Project

This project uses this improved USB module as a starting point, and creates a USB DFU bootloader that can be used to program FPGA boards with
the host tools like `dfu-util` on Linux or DfuSe on Windows.

This is currently being developed on a Lattice ice40up5k-b-evn, which is doing a poor job of meeting timing due to the slower design of the
ice40 UltraPlus family. Eventually we hope to test this on a TinyFPGA BX, and ultimately the [Logicbone](http://github.com/oskirby/logicbone).

**Interface**

The interface to the code looks like the following:

``` verilog
usb_dfu u_u (
  .clk_48mhz  (clk_48mhz),
  .reset      (reset),

  // USB pins
  .pin_usb_p( pin_usb_p ),
  .pin_usb_n( pin_usb_n ),

  // SPI pins
  .spi_csel( spi_csel ),
  .spi_clk ( spi_clk ),
  .spi_mosi( spi_mosi ),
  .spi_miso( spi_miso )
);
```

**Clock**

You will need a 48Mhz clock.  This can be generated by pll from the TinyFPGA BX's 16Mhz oscillator.

``` verilog
SB_PLL40_CORE #(
		.FEEDBACK_PATH("SIMPLE"),
		.DIVR(4'b0000),		// DIVR =  0
		.DIVF(7'b0101111),	// DIVF = 47
		.DIVQ(3'b100),		// DIVQ =  4
		.FILTER_RANGE(3'b001)	// FILTER_RANGE = 1
	) uut (
		.LOCK(locked),
		.RESETB(1'b1),
		.BYPASS(1'b0),
		.REFERENCECLK(clock_in),
		.PLLOUTCORE(clock_out)
		);
```

In this project, the pll is contained in its own module (pll.v) that is created by the IceStorm project tool `icepll`.

Amazingly, the 48MHz signal can also be generated by dividing down a faster clock.  Using an `icepll` configured pll at 192MHz, a 48MHz signal can be derived the simple way, by divider, and (possibly unnecessarily) put through the global buffer network for distribution.  This worked for a few experiments, but probably requires more development and testing to confirm.  Perhaps it can be done better.

``` verilog
wire clk_192mhz;
wire clk_locked;

// Use an icepll generated pll to give us 192MHz
pll pll192( .clock_in(pin_clk), .clock_out(clk_192mhz), .locked(clk_locked) );

reg [4:0] reset_counter = 0;

// Generate the slower clock
reg       clk_48mhz_logic;
reg [1:0] clk_divider;
always @(posedge clk_192mhz ) begin
    if ( ~clk_locked ) begin
        clk_divider <= 0;
    end else begin
        case (clk_divider)
            0: begin
                clk_48mhz_logic <= 1;
                clk_divider <= 1;
            end
            1: begin
                clk_divider <= 2;
            end
            2: begin
                clk_48mhz_logic <= 0;
                clk_divider <= 3;
            end
            3: begin
                clk_divider <= 0;
            end
      endcase
  end
end

// This clock has to go places.  Put it through a global buffer
wire clk_48mhz;
SB_GB gbc(
    .USER_SIGNAL_TO_GLOBAL_BUFFER (clk_48mhz_logic),
    .GLOBAL_BUFFER_OUTPUT ( clk_48mhz ) );
```

**Device Pins**

The pins in the interface to the module (`pin_usb_p` and `pin_usb_n`) are the raw device pins, the direction control logic is internal to `usb_dfu_i40`.  The original usb_dfu module is retained below to facilitate reuse in other architectures.

Somewhere the USB pull up pin has to be asserted.  This is done in the top level code, since usb_dfu doesn't manipulate it.

``` verilog
assign pin_pu = 1'b1;
```
## Use

Development has been done on Ubuntu.

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/oskirby/tinydfu-.git
```

and enter the directory

`cd tinydfu-bootloader`

And make it!

`make`

The make process has got to do a few things so it may take a minute.

If it completes successfully, press the "program" button on the TinyFPGA BX and program it

`make prog`

If all went well, you will then see a new port which you can connect to with a serial terminal emulator (on Ubuntu the port is /dev/ttyACM0 and a good terminal program is **gtkterminal** since it doesn't seem to get upset if you forget to disconnect before reprogramming).

For this demo, characters typed are rather unspectacularly just echo'ed back.

`make gui`

Let's you perform the place and route manually and generate pretty pictures like the ones above.

## Dependencies

Nothing is required beyond the usual tools needed for TinyFPGA development.  This is a command-line makefile project.

## Debug

There is some debug instrumentation left in the code.  This will just disappear if you don't use it.  For the Device Host bug, there were 16 lines connected to the hardware to present as much state as possible from the USB stack for debugging.  Here's one resulting screenshot where the interface is working to near capacity.

![](usb_serial_deep_debug.png)

- D0 - trigger (to send a 40-ish byte block if the last one was done)
- D1 Pipeline Data[ 0 ] (toggles when presented with a sequence of odd-even data)
- D2 Pipeline Valid - there is data available
- D3 Pipeline Ready - the data can be accepted
- D4 USB SERIAL IN State Machine[0] - controlling the pipeline from FPGA to Host (usb_spiflash_bridge.v)
- D5 USB SERIAL IN State Machine[1]
- D6 `in_ep_data_done` (asserted when a partial outgoing buffer should be sent)
- D7  `in_ep_data_free` (asserted while the usb serial sysyem can accept data)
- D8 - EP State Machine[0] - `current_ep_state` (usb_fs_in_pe.v)
- D9 - EP State Machine[1]
- D10 - IN TX State Machine[0] - `in_xfr_state` (usb_fs_in_pe.v)
- D11 - IN TX State Machine[1]
- D12 - Bytes available to Tx - this indicates that there are bytes to send the USB transmitter
- D13 - Byte to Tx - this is the strobe of the next byte into the USB transmitter
- D14 - Receiver Message Start - the USB receiver has received a message start (an IN token or Ack here)
- D15 - Receiver Message End - the USB receiver has received a message start (an IN token or Ack here)

Overall, you can see the data source pipelining data (D1) into the buffer whenever the USB port is ready (D3).  When a buffer is full, the interface waits (EP State Machine D9,D8 = 1,0) until it gets an IN Token (D14,D15).  When this happens, the waiting buffer is sent as fast as the USB lines can send send them.  The interface waits for an ACK (D14,D15) and when all is well, signals up the stack that it's ready to fill another buffer.  And the cycle restarts.

## Issues

**Pipeline Interface**

Run slowly, the pipeline is pretty simple.  Data is available (`valid`), receiver (signaling `ready`) receives it.  Wait.  Repeat.  You can certainly use it in a simple way by de-asserting `ready` every cycle forcing the interface into a two step (`valid` `ready`, `valid` `~ready`).  The logic to do this is pretty simple.

Where the pipeline shines is when data is streaming - one in, one out every clock cycle, (as happens in multibyte transfers), but for a simple seeming interface, and one that appears in near all FPGA code, a pipeline like this can be *fiendishly* complex to implement, especially for modules both receiving and sending data.  Implementers *must* have a firm grasp on their `=`'s vs `<=`'s, know their `always @(*)`'s from their `always @(posedge clk)`'s, and really understand combinatorial vs registered signals.

Here's a taste.  Consider a pipeline module, m with both upstream and downstream communicating partners.  The main area of complexity happens when data is streaming (`valid` and `ready` are asserted by all).  Every clock, data is flowing from the upstream module into m, and from m into the downstream module below it. Suddenly the downstream module gets busy or is itself held up for some reason and it lowers `ready`.  When this happens module m has to latch the data that it is currently sending (since data is transferred only when *both* parties agree), hold `valid` high and wait.  Meanwhile the upstream module's data *was considered transfered*.  So the poor module m in the middle has to both latch its data word and store the new overflow one and just hang out.  Then when the downstream module finally signals that it's ready (raising the `ready` line), module m first needs to give it the original data, then the stored overflow data, and only then can it start accepting data again (raising its `ready` to the upstream module).  Getting all this in your head and implemented correctly can take days (or weeks)

Mr ZipCPU talks about pipelining a lot here - https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html . He uses "STB" and "Busy" as his signals, and his development of the subject is pretty nice.  I haven't used his code.  There are a few places where I have skeptical squint-eye, and so to not end up balling and throwing things every time I implemented something pipeline-y, I ended up writing my own pipeline code from scratch.

So, feel free to use this interface, or put another one on it!  Maybe someone will create a whole suite of pipelined modules to do stuff...

**Command Line**

There are rumors that some people don't like command-line tools.  If you (or a friend) think you might be one of these people, please feel free to connect this project to your other fancy environment (Apio, PlatformIO) and submit the appropriate files so others may experience these delights.

## Fixed Issues

**Design Passing Timing**

Originally some long constants were creating very long carry chains.  The code could never be made to pass at 48MHz.  This was dangerous since some parts under some conditions might not work.  Now it does pass!

```
Info: Max frequency for clock 'clk_48mhz_$glb_clk': 51.60 MHz (PASS at 48.00 MHz)
```

For reference, there were a few places like the following:

usb/usb_fs_out_pe.v:185
```
              if (ep_get_addr[ep_num][5:0] >= (ep_put_addr[ep_num][5:0] - 2)) begin
```

usb/usb_fs_out_pe.v:212
```
          ep_get_addr_next[ep_num][5:0] <= ep_get_addr[ep_num][5:0] + 1;
```

In these cases, the constant is interpreted as 32b and the whole operation is conducted at that width.  32b long carry chains can not be done at 48MHz in the iCE40. The fix was for these needed to become explicitly shorter.

usb/usb_fs_out_pe.v:185
```
              if (ep_get_addr[ep_num][5:0] >= (ep_put_addr[ep_num][5:0] - 6'H2)) begin
```

usb/usb_fs_out_pe.v:212
```
          ep_get_addr_next[ep_num][5:0] <= ep_get_addr[ep_num][5:0] + 6H'1;
```

So that the full 32b addition and subtraction was not conducted.  This is possibly an issue with yosys (and may even be already fixed) since the Xilinx Vivado tools just silently ignore all the extra bits.  This kind of problem occurs in a few other places.  See the relevant [commit](https://github.com/davidthings/tinyfpga_bx_usbserial/commit/d9e157e09c166894e25777a0037a3c3d1592f135) for more.


**Device-Host Bug**

If the device sent data when the host was not ready, bad things happened.  If the device sent more than 32 bytes in a single burst, bad things happened. Only good things happen now from single bytes up to streams almost at link capacity.

**32 Character Bug**

Turns out that was all me.  Fixed now.

**Back Pressure Bugs**

The OUT EP interface (characters from the host) would stutter a little sometimes when the pipeline signaled `~ready`.  This is fixed now.

**Send Timeout**

The IN EP (characters to the host) employed a very aggressive policy for buffer termination.  Whenever the pipeline went dry - `~valid` it would send the bytes already received, initiating a whole packet turnaround.  This is not ideal when a pipeline may stop for a cycle or two periodically.  So now when there's a pause, the IN EP waits for up to 8 cycles before dispatching the packet.
