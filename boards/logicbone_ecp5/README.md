TinyDFU for the Logicbone ECP5
==============================
This port allows the DFU bootloader to operate on a Logicbone ECP5 board.

At power-on, the `BOOT` is checked to see if the board should remain in
bootloader mode, or if the board should boot into the user image after a
short timeout.

When the bootloader is running, but idle, LED0 will blink at a little more
than 1Hz. When the bootloader is running and a `DFU_UPLOAD` or `DFU_DNLOAD`
operation is inprogress, the LEDs will cycle back and forth.

Building
========
A `Makefile` has been provided that allows you to build and program the DFU
bootloader. It supports the following make targets:

| Target         | Description                                                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bootloader`   | Build the bootloader bitstream for an Logicbone ECP5        |
| `prog`         | Program the bootloader into the FPGA using OpenOCD.         |
| `dfu`          | Program the bootloader into the flash using dfu-util.       |
| `clean`        | Delete any files generated by the build.                    |

The FPGA device can be overridden by specifying a `DEVICE=--um5g-45k` argument
to make if you have a Logicbone with a different FPGA size. The default value
is `--um5g-45k`, which builds for an LFE5UM5G-45F.
